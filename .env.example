# Frontend Environment Variables Example
# Note: In Angular, environment variables are typically configured in environment.ts files
# This file serves as documentation for what configuration is needed

# Auth0 Configuration (Public - these go in environment.ts files)
# AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-tenant.us.auth0.com
# AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here

# MapBox Configuration (Public API Key - restrict by domain in MapBox dashboard)
# MAPBOX_PUBLIC_KEY=pk.your_mapbox_public_key_here

# API Configuration
# API_URL=http://localhost:8080 (development)
# API_URL=https://your-backend-api.com (production)

# Frontend URL
# FE_APP_URL=http://localhost:4200 (development)
# FE_APP_URL=https://your-frontend-app.com (production)

# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# 1. Frontend environment variables in Angular are configured in:
#    - src/environments/environment.development.ts (development)
#    - src/environments/environment.ts (production)
#    - src/environments/environment.preview.ts (preview deployments)
#
# 2. These files are typically committed to source control in Angular projects
#    because they are compiled into the build
#
# 3. NEVER put sensitive secrets in frontend environment files
#    Only public configuration and API keys that are domain-restricted
#
# 4. For sensitive operations, always use backend API endpoints
