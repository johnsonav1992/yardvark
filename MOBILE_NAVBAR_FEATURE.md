# Mobile Bottom Navbar Feature

## Overview
The mobile version of Yardvark now features a modern bottom navigation bar, similar to popular mobile apps like Google Photos. This replaces the mobile hamburger menu with a more accessible and contemporary navigation pattern.

## Features

### Bottom Navigation Bar
- **Fixed Position**: Always visible at the bottom of the screen on mobile devices
- **4 Primary Icons**: Displays 4 customizable navigation items
- **More Menu**: Access remaining navigation items via the "More" button (hamburger icon)
- **Safe Area Support**: Properly handles notched devices with safe area insets
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatically adapts to the app's dark mode setting

### Customization
Users can customize which 4 navigation items appear in the bottom bar:
1. Open the "More" menu (rightmost button in the bottom navbar)
2. Tap "Customize navbar"
3. Select exactly 4 items from the available options
4. Save your preferences

The customization is stored in localStorage and persists across sessions.

### Default Configuration
By default, the bottom navbar displays:
1. Dashboard
2. Entry Log
3. Products
4. Analytics

### Additional Features in More Menu
The More menu provides access to:
- Remaining navigation items (not in the primary 4)
- Customize navbar button
- Give feedback button
- Dark Mode toggle

## Technical Details

### Components Added
- `MobileBottomNavbarComponent`: The main bottom navbar component
- `NavbarCustomizationDialogComponent`: Dialog for customizing navbar items
- `BottomNavbarPreferencesService`: Service for managing user preferences

### Breakpoint
The bottom navbar appears on devices with screen width â‰¤ 900px (MD_BREAKPOINT)

### Desktop Behavior
Desktop users continue to see the traditional sidebar navigation - no changes to desktop experience.

### Removed Features
- Mobile hamburger menu button in the header (replaced by "More" menu in bottom navbar)
- Mobile drawer sidebar (replaced by bottom navbar + More menu)

## Styling
The bottom navbar uses PrimeNG design tokens to ensure consistency with the rest of the application and automatically adapts to theme changes.
