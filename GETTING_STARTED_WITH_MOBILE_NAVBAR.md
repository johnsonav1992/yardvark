# Getting Started with the Mobile Bottom Navbar

## Quick Start

The mobile bottom navbar is now live! Here's what you need to know:

### For Mobile Users

1. **Open the app on a mobile device** (screen width â‰¤ 900px)
2. You'll see a **bottom navigation bar** with 4 icons by default:
   - ðŸ“Š Dashboard
   - ðŸ“… Entry Log
   - ðŸ“¦ Products
   - ðŸ“ˆ Analytics
   - â˜° More

3. **To navigate**, simply tap any icon in the bottom bar
4. **To access other features**, tap the "More" button (â˜°) on the right

### Customizing Your Navbar

Want different icons in your bottom bar? Here's how:

1. Tap the **"More"** button (â˜°) at the bottom right
2. In the drawer that opens, tap **"Customize navbar"**
3. Select exactly **4 items** from the grid:
   - Dashboard
   - Entry Log
   - Soil data
   - Products
   - Equipment
   - Analytics
   - Calculators
4. Tap **"Save"**

Your preferences are automatically saved and will persist across sessions!

### Accessing Settings

The "More" menu also includes:
- **Give feedback** button
- **Dark Mode** toggle

These were previously in the mobile sidebar and are now easily accessible in the More menu.

### For Desktop Users

No changes! Desktop users (screen width > 900px) will continue to see the traditional sidebar navigation.
