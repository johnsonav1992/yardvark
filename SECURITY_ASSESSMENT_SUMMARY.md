| **Total Documentation** | | **31.3 KB** | ‚úÖ |

### 3. Configuration Updates

- ‚úÖ Updated .gitignore for environment file protection
- ‚úÖ Enhanced main.ts with security middleware
- ‚úÖ Updated app.module.ts with security guards
- ‚úÖ Configured rate limiting with built-in decorators
- ‚úÖ Updated README with security information

---

## Security Measures Verified

### Already in Place ‚úÖ

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Auth0 integration with JWT tokens
   - Global JWT guard on all endpoints
   - Public route decorator for exceptions
   - User data isolation (userId checks)

2. **Database Security**
   - TypeORM with parameterized queries
   - No SQL injection vulnerabilities found
   - Proper user data isolation

3. **CORS Configuration**
   - Properly configured for production domain
   - Supports Netlify preview deployments
   - Credentials enabled appropriately

4. **Code Quality**
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - ESLint configured
   - No critical vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Newly Implemented ‚úÖ

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Protects all endpoints
   - Configurable per route
   - Can be bypassed with decorator when needed

6. **Security Headers**
   - Helmet middleware configured
   - Multiple protection layers added

7. **Input Validation**
   - Global validation pipe
   - Automatic sanitization
   - Type safety enforcement

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks: üü° LOW (with conditions)

| Risk Category | Before | After | Notes |
|--------------|--------|-------|-------|
| API Abuse | üî¥ HIGH | üü¢ LOW | Rate limiting implemented |
| Injection Attacks | üü¢ LOW | üü¢ LOW | TypeORM + validation |
| XSS/Clickjacking | üü° MEDIUM | üü¢ LOW | Helmet headers added |
| Brute Force Auth | üü° MEDIUM | üü° MEDIUM | Needs Auth0 config* |
| Data Breach | üü¢ LOW | üü¢ LOW | Strong isolation |
| DDoS | üî¥ HIGH | üü° MEDIUM | Rate limiting + infra |

\* *Will be LOW once Auth0 brute force protection is enabled (manual step)*

---

## Manual Steps Required

Before enabling public access, complete these steps:

### Critical (Must Do) üî¥

1. **Auth0 Configuration** (15 minutes)
   - Remove/modify email whitelist
   - Enable brute force protection
   - Configure email verification
   - Set callback/logout URLs
   - See: `auth0-actions/ENABLE_PUBLIC_ACCESS.md`

2. **Environment Variables** (10 minutes)
   - Verify all secrets in production
   - Rotate any default credentials
   - See: `backend/.env.example`

3. **API Key Restrictions** (10 minutes)
   - Restrict MapBox key by domain
   - Set usage limits on AI APIs

### Important (Should Do) üü°

4. **Monitoring Setup** (30-60 minutes)
   - Application performance monitoring
   - Error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
   - Uptime monitoring
   - Log aggregation

5. **Database Backups** (15 minutes)
   - Configure automated backups
   - Test restore procedure
   - Set retention policy

### Recommended (Nice to Have) üü¢

6. **Testing**
   - Complete deployment checklist
   - Load testing
   - Security penetration testing

7. **Legal/Compliance**
   - Privacy policy
   - Terms of service
   - GDPR compliance (if applicable)
